  * Assumes sex-biased dispersal
  * Assumes 18 generations (conservative estimate) of gene flow post contact
  
* Simulate gene flow of biparentally inhertied nuDNA across the landscape [SimulatedGeneFlow_nuDNA.R]
  * Assumes sex-biased dispersal
  * Assumes 18 generations (conservative estimate) of gene flow post contact
