# Geographic Cline Analysis

## Expected Cline Width (assuming neutral gene glow)

* Simulate gene flow of maternally inherited mtDNA across the landscape [SimulatedGeneFlow_mtDNA.R]
  * Assumes sex-biased dispersal
  * Assumes 18 generations (conservative estimate) of gene flow post contact
  
* Simulate gene flow of biparentally inhertied nuDNA across the landscape [SimulatedGeneFlow_nuDNA.R]
  * Assumes sex-biased dispersal
  * Assumes 18 generations (conservative estimate) of gene flow post contact
  
* Estimate cline width (simulated data)
  * [SimulatedClineWidth_nuDNA.R]
  * [SimulatedClineWidth_mtDNA.R]
