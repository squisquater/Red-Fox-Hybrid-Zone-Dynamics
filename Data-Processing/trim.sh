## This is an example of the trimming script used on demultiplexed reads for a single hiseq library
#This script uses ngsShoRT to specify the use of two threads (-t 2)
#single end reads (-se)
#trim off any remaining 5â€™ adapter sequences that are illumina multiplex specific (-5a_f i-m)
#and trims reads with >50% of bases having a quality score of <2 (-methods lqr -lqs 2 -lq_p 50)
